**xnNightclub**

The Galaxy Nightclub added to Vespucci Beach with clientside NPCs. Weapons cannot be used inside the club and NPCs cannot be interacted with. You could change the nightclub style if you wanted by changing the Interior Entity Sets in the EntitySets variable but I can't really be bothered to tell you how to do that.

**Installation**

Copy xnNightclub to your resources folder and add `start xnNightclub` to your server.cfg
